## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-26

OpenCode **V2** compatibility release. The plugin now loads on OpenCode v2.0.x while remaining backward compatible with V1.

### Added

- **OpenCode V2 plugin support** — The package entry point now exports a dual V1/V2 plugin object (`{ id, setup, server }`), matching the `@opencode/plugin` `Plugin.define` contract. OpenCode V2 reads `id`/`setup`; OpenCode V1 (1.18.29+) reads `server`. Fixes the load error `Plugin must export a default definition with an id and an effect or setup function.`
- **`src/v2.ts` adapter** — Bridges the V2 `Context` to the existing V1 notification engine:
  - **Shell runner shim** — V2 no longer provides the `$` helper, so a `node:child_process` based runner re-implements the tagged-template API (`.quiet()`, `.nothrow()`, `.timeout(ms)`) used by the audio/TTS/volume helpers.
  - **Client shim** — Maps `session.get` to `ctx.session.get` and keeps a safe no-op `tui.showToast` (V2 exposes no plugin-facing toast API).
  - **Event translation** — Converts V2 events (`session.created`, `session.execution.succeeded`, `session.execution.failed`, `permission.asked`, `permission.replied`, `form.created`, `form.replied`, `form.cancelled`, `session.inbox.enqueued`) into the V1 `{ type, properties }` shape consumed by the existing handler.
- **New unit tests** (`tests/unit/v2-adapter.test.ts`) covering the dual entry point, event translation, de-duplication, session→location routing, shell shim, client shim, and `setup()` wiring.

### Fixed

- **Completion notifications on V2** — V2 defines `session.idle` in its event schema but never emits it; the actual agent-completion signal is `session.execution.succeeded`. The adapter now maps it to the idle/completion handler so the "task finished" notification, sound, and TTS fire again.
- **Duplicated/echoed audio on V2** — V2 loads the plugin once per location while every instance shares one process-wide event stream. Two guards were added: process-wide event-id de-duplication, and location filtering backed by a session→location registry so location-less events (e.g. `session.execution.succeeded`) are routed to the correct instance.

### Changed

- **`src/index.ts`** is now a thin dual-export entry point; the V1 implementation moved verbatim to **`src/plugin.ts`** (exported as the named `SmartVoiceNotifyPlugin`).
- **`package.json`** — Version bumped to `1.5.0`; added `@opencode/plugin` dependency; added an `exports` map and a root `server.js` bridge entrypoint; added `opencode-v2` keyword; `build`/`build:types` scripts renamed to `compile`/`compile:types` so git installs do not trigger a failing npm prepare step; `msedge-tts` moved to `optionalDependencies` (it is only a lazy fallback for the `edge` engine).
- **Tests** now import the named `SmartVoiceNotifyPlugin` export from `src/index.js`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-11

A compatibility and polish release. Adds full OpenCode SDK v1/v2 client shape support, voice caching, VS Code focus detection, config hot-reload, and brings all dependencies up to date.

### Added

- **Voice caching** — TTS audio can now be cached to disk (`enableVoiceCache`, `voiceCacheDir`, `voiceCacheMaxSizeMB`) to avoid redundant synthesis for repeated messages.
- **VS Code focus detection** — Focus detection now recognises VS Code, VS Code Insiders, and VSCodium across Windows, macOS, and Linux, suppressing notifications when the integrated terminal is focused.
- **Config hot-reload** — The plugin detects changes to `smart-voice-notify.jsonc` via file signature (mtime + size) and refreshes configuration without requiring a restart.
- **OpenCode SDK v2 client shape support** — `session.get` and `tui.showToast` now auto-detect v1/v2 API shapes and fall back gracefully, ensuring compatibility with both `@opencode-ai/plugin` v1.x and v2.x surfaces.
- **Expanded `Session` and `TUIToastPayload` types** — SDK types now cover `slug`, `workspaceID`, `path`, `agent`, `model`, `cost`, `tokens`, `share`, and toast `directory`/`workspace` fields present in newer SDK versions.

### Changed

- **Version bumped** from `1.3.3` to `1.4.0`.
- **Dependencies updated**:
  - `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js` → `^2.52.0`
  - `detect-terminal` → `^3.0.0`
  - `msedge-tts` → `^2.0.5`
  - `@types/node` → `^22.19.21`
  - `bun-types` → `^1.3.14`
  - `typescript` → `^6.0.3`
- **TypeScript 6 compatibility** — Added `"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"` to `tsconfig.json` to silence the `baseUrl` deprecation introduced in TypeScript 6.0 without changing build behaviour.
- **`.gitignore` rewrite** — Comprehensive coverage for node_modules, OS artifacts, IDE/editor files, logs, caches, temp, coverage, build output, and local environment files. `bun.lock` is no longer ignored so lockfiles can be tracked for reproducible installs.
- **Permission/question batch windows** are now read dynamically from config (`getPermissionBatchWindowMs()` / `getQuestionBatchWindowMs()`) instead of captured once at startup.
- **README** — Added section clarifying OpenCode's built-in notifications vs. this plugin's capabilities; updated SDK version references to v1/v2 terminology.

### Housekeeping

- **Test files renamed** — Removed `issue-` prefixes from three test files: `voice-caching.test.ts`, `vscode-focus.test.ts`, `performance-regression.test.ts`. No functional changes; all 747 tests continue to pass.
- **Lockfile regenerated** with updated dependency versions.
